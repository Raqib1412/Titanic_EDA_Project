# Titanic Survival Prediction 🚢
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster. Using the Titanic dataset, we clean and preprocess the data, explore key patterns, and apply logistic regression for classification.
Done By:- Mohammed Raqib.
## 📌 Objectives
- Explore and understand the dataset
- Clean and preprocess missing or irrelevant data
- Visualize survival trends by gender, class, and other features
- Build a logistic regression model to predict survival
- Evaluate model performance using standard metrics

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries
- Python
- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## 📊 Workflow
1. **Load the Dataset**  
   Use Seaborn’s built-in Titanic dataset or import from CSV.
2. **Data Exploration**  
   View structure, check for missing values, and identify relevant features.
3. **Visualization**  
   Use charts to understand trends (e.g., survival by gender, class).
4. **Data Cleaning**  
   Fill or drop missing values and remove irrelevant columns.
5. **Feature Encoding**  
   Convert categorical data to numeric for model compatibility.
6. **Model Training**  
   Apply logistic regression and train the model using training data.
7. **Model Evaluation**  
   Use accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report to assess performance.

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- Try advanced models like Random Forest or XGBoost
- Improve preprocessing with feature scaling or outlier handling
- Perform cross-validation for more reliable results
